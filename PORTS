This file is part of the _scotty_ Tcl extension for network
management.  It describes how to build on different platforms.

Debian, Ubuntu
==============

Needed packages to be install with `apt-get`:

    build-essentials tcl8.6-dev tk8.6-dev autoconf

Configure with:

    ./configure


Alpine Linux
============

From a default install to _scotty_ on [Alpine Linux][] you need to
install the following packages with `apk add`:

    build-base linux-headers tcl-dev tk-dev libtirpc-dev

Configure the build with:

    ./configure --with-tirpc

Alpine Linux does not build against the GNU C Library (glibc), instead
it uses the [musl libc][].  _musl_ does not feature a complete Sun RPC
implementation, but Alpine packages the [tirpc][] library which can be
used instead.  It is supposed, that you can build _scotty_ against
_tirpc_ on any platform, where this library is available.

Slackware Linux
===============

Required packages:

	tcl/tcl-8.6.5-x86_64-2.txz
	tcl/tk-8.6.5-x86_64-2.txz
	d/autoconf-2.69-noarch-1.txz

Configure with:

	./configure
	

FreeBSD
=======

Required packages to be installed with `pkg install`:

    tcl86-8.6.6_2 tk86-8.6.6 autoconf

Configure with:

    ./configure


NetBSD
======

Required packages to be installed with `pkg install`:

	tcl tk autoconf

Configure with:

	./configure --with-tcl=/usr/pkg/lib --with-tk=/usr/pkg/lib


MacOSX
======

Install [Active State Tcl][], the community edition will do.  It will
install the development files in `/Library/Frameworks/Tcl.framework`
and `/Library/Frameworks/Tk.framework`.

Install [Xcode][] from Apple.

Configure with:

    ./configure --bindir=/usr/local/bin/ --libdir=/Library/Tcl


MINIX3
======

There is highly experimental support for MINIX3.  At the moment of
writing this (20170311) minix does not have official support for
sunrpc.  However the community member sambuc has kindly imported the
sunrpc implementation of NetBSD into minix.

Please read the file README.minix if you are interested in scotty on
MINIX3.


Solaris 11.3
============

Install Tcl/Tk from sources, the installation provided by Oracle does
not include the private header files.

Download the source tarballs, unpack, enter the unix subdirectory and
do the standard

	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

To install into `/usr/local`.

Configure scotty with:

	cd tnm
	./configure --with-tcl=/usr/local/lib
	cd ../tkined
	./configure --with-tcl=/usr/local/lib --with-tk=/usr/local/lib
